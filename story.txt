Note: Poem from first edit, misread assignment

Once upon a time, there was a driver. This driver drove a brand new bike.
In this bike, was a spotless shiny engine. It definitely blinded the
nearby drivers. As a result, they all gave the bike's rider priority. What
a time to have a shiny engine.

As a result, the bike rider rode with his shiny engine and tried to merge onto
the expressway. However, due to other riders being blinded, it would prove
that there would be a merge conflict when trying to get on the expressway.

The conflict was only resolved when a nearby policeman, equipping himself
with the latest model of shiny engine-proof sunglasses, pulled the driver
aside and said, "Git off mah street."

The bike rider took his journey on the grass instead. What a time to have a 
shiny engine.
